                 Recently, I've been subscribing to more and more newsletters. It's a great way to learn about <a href="https://unicorner.news/">cool new products</a>, <a href="https://www.factoftheday1.com/">ideas</a> and all kinds
                 of interesting things! Newsletters are meant to spark thoughts and discussion, however, it's currently a one way street. Writers share their content
                 but often have very little knowledge of what their readers think of it. Me and 4 of my friends want to change that! So we decided to build <a href="https://app.tryfeedbee.com/">FeedBee</a> to help newsletter writers get better feedback.
                </div> 

                <div class="margin-top">
                  We wanted to make the process more direct for readers by allowing them to voice their thoughts through links in the newsletters themselves! 
                  Their click directly records their 'vote' in our database and then sends them to a form where they can provide more personal insights. We also wanted to 
                  present all this data to writers in an organized manner with engaging charts and dashboards. 
                  On the team, I interview newsletter writers to understand their needs and also do some design stuff but am primarily working on developing the software. We recently launched on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/feedbee">product hunt</a> and got 7 customers on our free trial! :)
                  We have a long way to go and I am excited to work on awesome new features and improve FeedBee with my incredible team!

                <div class="margin-top">
                    I was the project lead (along with the amazing Julia Ring) for <a href="http://mheal.engin.umich.edu/csfglobal">CSF Global Partnership</a>, a student-run project team. 
                    Our team formed when Dr. Tasneem Karim, a researcher at an NGO, <a href="https://csf-global.org/">CSF Global</a> reached out to collaborate on a project 
                    that aims to empower children with Cerebral Palsy in Bangladesh. We conducted a <a href="https://global.umich.edu/newsroom/study-abroad-u-m-top-among-big-ten-universities/">needs assessment</a> in Sirajganj, Bangladesh in Summer 2019 to better understand the day to
                    day challenges faced by children with Cerebral Palsy and their caregivers. We met with Bangladeshi nutrition
                    experts such as Dr. Khurshid Talukder and Moushumi Khan, who is a UofM alumna and runs the NGO Foundation for Charitable
                    Activities in Bangladesh (FCAB), before and during our needs assessment trip to gain more insights into the challenges and how we can make our future intervention effective. 
                </div>
                <div class="margin-top">
                    Several families mentioned difficulty feeding their child and that their child was unable to feed themselves. 
                    We also observed mothers feeding their children during therapy sessions, instead of the child working to feed 
                    themselves. Children with Cerebral palsy also have a higher incidence of malnutrition because they have difficulty 
                    chewing and swallowing. 
                </div>
                <div class="margin-top">
                    This is why our team decided to focus on alleviating the childrens’ feeding and nutritional problems. The education subteam is working to create an information booklet that allows caregivers to easily access posture tips, 
                    ways to modify the texture of food and recipes for affordable food that is best suited for children 
                    who have Cerebral palsy. Whereas the assistive device subteam is working to create an assistive plate and glove 
                    that makes it easier for children with Cerebral palsy to feed independently.

                <div class="margin-top">
                    My teammates and I created the Spirelephant as part of EECS 495: Software for Access. After surgery, the alveoli
                    in the lungs of patients close up, which is why doctors recommend that they do breathing exercises using a device
                    called a spirometer. But patients often do not do these exercises because it feels too monotonous and doctors do not
                    have any way of checking up on them. This problem is worse for young children who may get bored easily. Enter: the Spirelephant!
                    It uses the patients' breaths as input to the game to control the on screen character Elly the elephant who completes various
                    tasks to help out her animal friends. I had a lot of fun creating the art for the game!

                  This past summer, I interned at Evolve Education. I worked with my team to design and implement a system for school children to help them with goal-setting, forming positive habits,

                It was an incredible to learn just how much thinking needs to go into making a system for real people - understanding their needs and brainstorming the
                best ways to tackle them was very enjoyable. I was able to dabble in design using Figma, and also did some research into gamification but I primarly worked
                on software development using Laravel (a PHP framework). I implemented functions to make custom charts using p5.js to represent data in a more fun and easy to parse way and also used Chart.js to create
                interactive charts. Finally, I also implemented a calendar and todo list system!

                  <a href="https://www.censoredplanet.org/">Censored Planet</a> is one of the projects led by Professor Roya Ensafi which focuses on 
                  remotely measuring and analyzing Internet censorship on different layers by using, developing and refining tools such

              <div class="margin-top">
                  During the pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the spread of misinformation which can be especially harmful
                  given how peoples' misguided views on how to curb the spread of the illness or whether it actually exists could lead them to behave in
                  ways that directly harm others. This has given a reason to authorities for <a href="https://fee.org/articles/the-censorship-of-covid-19-data-around-the-world/">increasing Internet and media censorship</a>. 

                  I was part of a team which analyzed Internet censorship specific to the COVID-19 pandemic using the tools Satellite (measures DNS layer censorship) 
                  and Quack (measures application layer censorship).
