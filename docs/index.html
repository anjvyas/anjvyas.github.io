                        <a href="https://www.censoredplanet.org/">Censored Planet</a> is one of the projects led by Professor Roya Ensafi which focuses on 
                        remotely measuring and analyzing Internet censorship on different layers by using, developing and refining tools such 
                        as Satellite and Hyper Quack.

                        During the pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the spread of misinformation which can be especially harmful
                        given how peoples' misguided views on how to curb the spread of the illness or whether it actually exists could lead them to behave in
                        ways that directly harm others. This has given a reason to authorities for <a href="https://fee.org/articles/the-censorship-of-covid-19-data-around-the-world/">increasing Internet and media censorship</a>. 

                        I was part of a team consisting of Ramakrishnan Sundara Raman, Nicholas Ceccio, Prerana Shenoy and Philipp Lutscher 
                        which analyzed Internet censorship specific to the COVID-19 pandemic using the tools Satellite (measures DNS layer censorship) 
                        and Quack (measures application layer censorship).

                        by understanding the challenges VPN users face while choosing and using VPNs, developing methodical and automated assessments of VPN performance and
                        understanding the rationale of VPN providers when they design and market their products. I am focusing on the aspects of this project which involve surveys along

                <div class="margin-top">
                    I am currently a project lead (along with the amazing Julia Ring) for <a href="http://mheal.engin.umich.edu/csfglobal">CSF Global Partnership</a>, a student-run project team. 
                    Our team formed when Dr. Tasneem Karim, a researcher at an NGO, <a href="https://csf-global.org/">CSF Global</a> reached out to collaborate on a project 
                    that aims to empower children with Cerebral Palsy in Bangladesh. We conducted a <a href="https://global.umich.edu/newsroom/study-abroad-u-m-top-among-big-ten-universities/">needs assessment</a> in Sirajganj, Bangladesh in Summer 2019 to better understand the day to
                    day challenges faced by children with Cerebral Palsy and their caregivers. Leading up to this we spent most of our time understanding
                    Cerebral Palsy, existing assistive technologies and therapy for it and the culture of Bangladesh. We met with Bangladeshi nutrition
                    experts such as Dr. Khurshid Talukder and Moushumi Khan, who is a UofM alumna and runs the NGO Foundation for Charitable
                    Activities in Bangladesh (FCAB), before and during our needs assessment trip to gain more insights into the challenges and how we can make our future intervention effective.

                <div class="margin-top">
                    Several families mentioned difficulty feeding their child and that their child was unable to feed themselves. 
                    We also observed mothers feeding their children during therapy sessions, instead of the child working to feed 
                    themselves. Children with Cerebral palsy also have a higher incidence of malnutrition because they have difficulty 
                    chewing and swallowing. Improving a child’s ability to self-feed will help to establish their independence and also 
                    improve their upper extremity motor function, which will be applicable to other areas of life. 
                </div>
                <div class="margin-top">
                    This is why our team decided to focus on alleviating the childrens’ feeding and nutritional problems. 
                    Currently we have an education subteam and an assistive device subteam. 
                    The education subteam is working to create an information booklet that allows caregivers to easily access posture tips, 
                    ways to modify the texture of food and recipes for affordable food that is best suited for children 
                    who have Cerebral palsy. Whereas the assistive device subteam is working to create an assistive plate and glove 
                    that makes it easier for children with Cerebral palsy to feed independently.

                <div class="margin-top">
                    My teammates and I created the Spirelephant as part of EECS 495: Software for Access. After surgery, the alveoli
                    in the lungs of patients close up, which is why doctors recommend that they do breathing exercises using a device
                    called a spirometer. But patients often do not do these exercises because it feels too monotonous and doctors do not
                    have any way of checking up on them. This problem is worse for young children who may get bored easily. Enter: the Spirelephant!
                    It uses the patients' breaths as input to the game to control the on screen character Elly the elephant who completes various
                    tasks to help out her animal friends. I had a lot of fun creating the art for the game!

                    In Summer 2019, I interned at Gumro and Associates in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Before this, I barely knew Web Development but working with the
                    other interns on real company projects, I was able to grasp a lot in a short time!

                    I created two web applications from scratch with the help of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">this stellar course</a>. The first one was used to connect 
                    customers with transporters in the most efficient way using bidding and the second one was a location tracker to 
                    assign trips to transporters and track deliveries. This helped the company keep track of deliveries that are running 
                    late in a much easier way than having to call transporters up while they are driving which was also potentially dangerous.
